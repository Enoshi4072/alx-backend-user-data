A minimal Application
- Has sth like this:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
	return 'Hello, World!'
- How the code works
a) Import the Flask class. An instance of the class becomes our WSGI application
b) Create an instance of the class. First arg is the name of the apps module or package. If one is using a single module, one should use __name__ bcos depending on if it's started module the name will be different. This enables Flask to knwo where to look for templates, static files...
c) Use the route() decorator to inform Flask what the URL should trigger our function
d) The fxn is given a name which is also used to generate URLs for that particular fxn, and return the message one wants to display in the user's browser
- Do not name it flask.py to avoid confliction
